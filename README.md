## FAQ

### Why Skills?

The value of skills lies in being shareable and on-demand.

Being shareable makes prompts easier to manage and reuse across projects. Being on-demand means skills can be pulled in as needed, scaling far beyond what any agent's context window could fit at once.

### Skills vs AGENTS.md

While `AGENTS.md` loads everything upfront for guaranteed respect by agents, skills offer a standardized, on-demand knowledge base that scales better. If you want certain skills to always apply, you can reference them directly in your `AGENTS.md`.
